# About the PROJECT #

ChatBot, the latest sensation (or just hype!), is believed to be the next paradigm shift in the technology. A conversational assistant will never be boring as it gives new experience each time the user is interacting with it.
A ChatBot need not be always intelligent. It can be as simple as storing userâ€™s notes, reminders, book tickets etc.. After all, satisfying the usecase is critical here.



Feel free to play with it (This simple bot has minimum capabilities, bring out your own creativity for tuning it).
